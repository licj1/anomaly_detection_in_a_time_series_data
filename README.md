python tutorial for anomaly detection in a time series data

In this tasks, prediction models are considered as to make prediction 
as the value of next time stamp for a time series of sensor measurements.

Then, the prediction error is defined as the deviation from this prediction to measurement
(target value). 

Finally, this prediction error can be used as a decision making component 
that can classify target value as normal or anomalous with considering threshold
